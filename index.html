    <p>This document defines an API that web page authors can use to
    cooperatively schedule background tasks such that they do not introduce
    delays to other high priority tasks that share the same event loop, such as
    input processing, animations and frame compositing. The user agent is in a
    better position to determine when background tasks can be run without
    introducing user-perceptible delays or jank in animations and input
    response, based on its knowledge of currently scheduled tasks, vsync
    deadlines, user-interaction and so on. Using this API should therefore
    result in more appropriate scheduling of background tasks during times when
    the browser would otherwise be idle.</p>

Vendors interested in implementing this document SHOULD join the mailing lists below and take part in the discussions.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Web pages often want to execute computation tasks on the browser's event
    loop which are not time-critical, but might take a significant portion of
    time to perform. Examples of such background tasks include recording
    analytics data, long running data processing operations, client-side
    templating and pre-rendering of content likely to become visible in the
    near future. These tasks must share the event loop with other time-critical
    operations, such as reacting to input and performing script-based
    animations using {{AnimationFrameProvider/requestAnimationFrame()}}. These
    background tasks are typically performed by scheduling a callback using
    {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout()}} and running the background task during that
    callback.</p>
    <p>A disadvantage of this approach is that the author of the script has no
    way to inform the user-agent as to whether a given {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout()}} callback is
    time-critical or could be delayed until the browser is otherwise idle. In
    addition, the user agent isn't able to provide the callback with any
    information about how long it can continue to execute without delaying
    time-critical operations and causing jank or other user-perceptible delays.
    As a result, the easiest way forward is for the author is to simply call
    {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout()}} with a very small value, and then execute the minimum possible
    chunk of work in the resulting callback and reschedule additional work with
    another call to {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout()}}. This is less than optimal because there is
    extra overhead from having to post many small tasks on the user agent's
    event loop and schedule their execution. It also relies on the user-agent
    interleaving other time-critical work between each of these callbacks
    appropriately, which is difficult since the user-agent can't make accurate
    assumptions on how long each of these callbacks are likely to take.</p>
    <p>The API described in this document allows script authors to request the
    user-agent to schedule a callback when it would otherwise be idle. The user
    agent provides an estimation of how long it expects to remain idle as a
    deadline passed to the callback. The page author can use the deadline to
    ensure that these background tasks don't impact latency-critical events
    such as animation and input response.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of using the API to write a background task.</p>

    <h2>Idle Periods</h2>
    <p>After input processing, rendering and compositing for a given frame has
    been completed, the user agent's main thread often becomes idle until
    either: the next frame begins; another pending task becomes eligible to
    run; or user input is received. This specification provides a means to
    schedule execution of callbacks during this otherwise idle time via a
    {{Window/requestIdleCallback()}} API.</p>
    <p>Callbacks posted via the {{Window/requestIdleCallback()}} API become eligible to
    run during user agent defined idle periods. When an idle callback is run it
    will be given a deadline which corresponds to the end of the current idle
    period. The decision as to what constitutes an idle period is user agent
    defined, however the expectation is that they occur in periods of
    quiescence where the browser expects to be idle.</p>
    <p>One example of an idle period is the time between committing a given
    frame to the screen and starting processing on the next frame during active
    animations, as shown in <a href="#figure1"></a>. Such idle periods will
    occur frequently during active animations and screen updates, but will
    typically be very short (i.e., less than 16ms for devices with a 60Hz vsync
    cycle).</p>

      "images/image01.png">
      <figcaption>
        Example of an inter-frame idle period
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="note">The web-developer should be careful to account for all work
    performed by operations during an idle callback. Some operations, such as
    resolving a promise or triggering a page layout, may cause subsequent tasks
    to be scheduled to run after the idle callback has finished. In such cases,
    the application should account for this additional work by yielding before
    the deadline expires to allow these operations to be performed before the
    next frame deadline.</p>
    <p>Another example of an idle period is when the user agent is idle with no
    screen updates occurring. In such a situation the user agent may have no
    upcoming tasks with which it can bound the end of the idle period. In order
    to avoid causing user-perceptible delays in unpredictable tasks, such as
    processing of user input, the length of these idle periods should be capped
    to a maximum value of <a href="#why50">50ms</a>. Once an idle period is
    finished the user agent can schedule another idle period if it remains
    idle, as shown in <a href='#figure2'></a>, to enable background work to
    continue to occur over longer idle time periods.</p>

    <!-- Image source avaliable at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zGgKAJVTDVgq0LpZDL3HD0jNiveivHb_V2Wb8C3jsEE/edit -->
    <figure id='figure2'>
      <img alt=
      "Example of an idle period when there are no pending frame updates." src=
      "images/image00.png">
      <figcaption>
        Example of an idle period when there are no pending frame updates
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>During an idle period the user agent will run idle callbacks in FIFO
    order until either the idle period ends or there are no more idle callbacks
    eligible to be run. As such, the user agent will not necessarily run all
    currently posted idle callbacks within a single idle period. Any remaining
    idle tasks are eligible to run during the next idle period.</p>
    <p class="note">To deliver the best performance developers are encouraged
    to eliminate unnecessary callbacks (e.g. requestAnimationFrame, setTimeout,
    and so on) that do not perform meaningful work; do not keep such callbacks
    firing and waiting for events to react, instead schedule them as necessary
    to react to events once they become available. Such pattern improves
    overall efficiency, and enables the user agent to schedule long idle
    callbacks (up to 50ms) that can be used to efficiently perform large blocks
    of background work.</p>
    <p>Only idle tasks which posted before the start of the current idle period
    are eligible to be run during the current idle period. As a result, if an
    idle callback posts another callback using {{Window/requestIdleCallback()}}, this
    subsequent callback won't be run during the current idle period. This
    enables idle callbacks to re-post themselves to be run in a future idle
    period if they cannot complete their work by a given deadline - i.e.,
    allowing code patterns like the following example, without causing the
    callback to be repeatedly executed during a too-short idle period:</p>
    <pre class='example highlight'>
function doWork(deadline) {
  if (deadline.timeRemaining() &lt;= 5) {
    // This will take more than 5ms so wait until we
    // get called back with a long enough deadline.
    requestIdleCallback(doWork);
    return;
  }
  // do work...
}
</pre>
    <p>At the start of the next idle period newly posted idle callbacks are
    appended to the end of the runnable idle callback list, thus ensuring that
    reposting callbacks will be run round-robin style, with each callback
    getting a chance to be run before that of an earlier task's reposted
    callback.</p>
    <p class="note">Future versions of this specification could allow other
    scheduling strategies. For example, schedule idle callback within the same
    idle period, a period that has at least <var>X</var> milliseconds of idle
    time, and so on. Current specification only supports the case for
    scheduling into the next idle period, at which time the callback can
    execute its logic, or repost itself into the next idle period.</p>
    <p>When the user agent determines that the web page is not user visible it
    can throttle idle periods to reduce the power usage of the device, for
    example, only triggering an idle period every 10 seconds rather than
    continuously.</p>
    <p>A final subtlety to note is that there is no guarantee that a user agent
    will have any idle CPU time available during heavy page load. As such, it
    is entirely acceptable that the user agent does not schedule any idle
    period, which would result in the idle callbacks posted via the
    {{Window/requestIdleCallback()}} API being postponed for a potentially unbounded
    amount of time. For cases where the author prefers to execute the callback
    within an idle period, but requires a time bound within which it can be
    executed, the author can provide the <code>timeout</code> property in the <code>options</code>
    argument to {{Window/requestIdleCallback()}}: if the specified timeout is reached
    before the callback is executed within an idle period, a task is queued to
    execute it.</p>
    <p class="note" id='why50'>The maximum deadline of 50ms is derived from
    studies [[RESPONSETIME]] which show that that a response to user input
    within 100ms is generally perceived as instantaneous to humans. Capping
    idle deadlines to 50ms means that even if the user input occurs immediately
    after the idle task has begun, the user agent still has a remaining 50ms in
    which to respond to the user input without producing user perceptible
    lag.</p>

    <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>When an idle callback is scheduled the user agent provides an estimate
    of how long it expects to remain idle. This information can be used to
    estimate the time taken by other application tasks and related browser work
    within that frame. However, developers can already access this information
    via other means - e.g. mark beginning of the frame via
    <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, estimate the time of the next frame, and use that
    information to compute "remaining time" within any callback.</p>
    <p>To mitigate cache and statistical fingerprinting attacks, the resolution
    of the time estimates returned by the <a>IdleDeadline</a> interface should
    be set to the same 5 microsecond minimum as the <code>Performance</code> interface
    defined in [[HR-TIME]].</p>
